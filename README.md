### Clean Strategy Comparison
![Clean Strategy Comparison](presentation_assets/1_clean_strategy_comparison.png)



This repository presents a structured framework for developing and evaluating AI-driven trading strategies, with a focus on **systematic risk premia**. The project integrates cutting-edge deep learning architectures with robust backtesting and interpretability tools â€” all within a modular and extensible research pipeline.


## Data Source
This project utilizes historical market data obtained through the **[EODHD APIs](https://eodhistoricaldata.com/financial-apis/)**. Their high-quality financial data has been instrumental in developing and testing AI-based trading strategies.


## Description:
This project deploys a systematic, AI-driven framework to develop and evaluate quantitative trading strategies. Our modular pipeline integrates robust API-based data acquisition with advanced feature engineeringâ€”including regime detection via Hidden Markov Modelsâ€”to produce high-quality inputs for our models. We implement a suite of deep learning architectures, including a GRU, a standalone LSTM model, and an LSTM-CNN hybrid, all validated through rolling cross-validation and realistic backtesting that incorporates transaction cost adjustments. Performance is benchmarked against a buy-and-hold baseline, and the framework supports rapid experimentation with alternative architectures such as LSTM with attention mechanisms and transformers. 

This project builds an end-to-end pipeline for evaluating deep learning models in financial markets. It includes:

- **API-driven data ingestion**
- **Feature engineering** (including regime detection using Hidden Markov Models)
- **Multi-architecture model experimentation** (GRU, LSTM, CNN-LSTM, Attention LSTM, Transformers)
- **Rolling-window validation and realistic backtesting**
- **Transaction cost sensitivity, risk-adjusted metrics, and hybrid overlays**
- **Explainability via attention weights and strategy diagnostics**

The final deliverable includes a strategy-ready version and a hybrid attention-based allocation prototype for future AI+XAI asset management models.


## Neural Networks for Trading Strategies
Neural networks (NNs) have been widely adopted in trading strategies due to their ability to model nonlinear relationships, detect patterns, and adapt to changing market conditions. The evolution of deep learning architectures, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and transformer-based models, has further enhanced their predictive power. NNs have revolutionized trading by enhancing prediction accuracy, optimizing execution, and identifying alpha signals in ways that traditional methods cannot. However, challenges such as interpretability, overfitting, and computational cost must be addressed for robust deployment.

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a specialized type of RNNs designed to handle sequential data and long-term dependenciesâ€”making them particularly well-suited for financial time-series forecasting and trading strategies. LSTMs are a powerful tool for time-series forecasting and trading, but they require careful tuning and robust validation. With recent advancements in deep learning, transformer architectures have proven highly effective in time-series forecasting, outperforming LSTMs and traditional statistical models.

### Transformer vs SPY Benchmark

Deep learning models enable systematic strategies to:
- Capture **non-linear relationships**
- Detect **regime shifts** and **volatility clusters**
- Generate adaptive **position sizing signals**

This project uses:
- **LSTM** for sequential modeling  
- **GRU** as a compact alternative  
- **CNN-LSTM** for local-global patterns  
- **Attention-LSTM** for interpretable dynamics  
- **Transformers** for end-to-end forecasting


#### LSTM with Attention-Based Trading Strategy
Our approach leverages a state-of-the-art deep learning architecture that combines the sequential modeling strengths of LSTM networks with an attention mechanism designed to isolate and weigh the most predictive segments of historical market data. This attention-based framework also opens promising avenues for systematic exploration in asset allocation strategies, enabling dynamic weighting of assets informed by adaptive market regime detection.

## Highlight: Attention-Based Allocation
This framework goes beyond signal generation â€” it shows how attention weights can be used for **interpretable, dynamic asset allocation**, bypassing traditional optimizers (e.g., covariance matrix inversion). It paves the way for **explainable AI (XAI)** in portfolio construction.
