# AI-based-Trading-Strategies
DL models based trading Strategies
Description:  
This project deploys a systematic, AI-driven framework to develop and evaluate quantitative trading strategies. Our modular pipeline integrates robust API-based data acquisition with advanced feature engineering—including regime detection via Hidden Markov Models—to produce high-quality inputs for our models. We implement a suite of deep learning architectures, including a GRU, a standalone LSTM model, and an LSTM-CNN hybrid, all validated through rolling cross-validation and realistic backtesting that incorporates transaction cost adjustments. Performance is benchmarked against a buy-and-hold baseline, and the framework supports rapid experimentation with alternative architectures such as LSTM with attention mechanisms and transformers. It provides a simple production-grade foundation for systematic strategy development into a maintainable, modular Python script suitable for production environments and version control.
